# Code Style
Standard

## <span style="color: rgb(220, 105, 1);"> Description for the code</span>
A general description for the every section on the top of the code to breifly explain the puopose of that section and some note for the section details.

  <div>
  <img src="assets/image/descriptionexample.png" alt="Description Example">
   *example for the section description*
  </div>

For easier reference, the location of the function will place inside its description
 ![functionlocation](assets/image/functionlocation.png) 

 * From the above example, this means that the location of the function is located in the part "qJS 8" insdie "questionJS.js" file
 
 
 * If the function located in the same js file, no prefix (i.e. questionJS in this example) will be shown
 ![functionlocation2](assets/image/functionlocation2.png) 


 * For function "saveToLocal" and "loadFromLocal", 4 different js file have been used for 4 different local storage location
      1. javascript - jsplayerResultArray
      2. css - cssplayerResultArray
      3. html - htmlplayerResultArray
      4. bootstrap - bsplayerResultArray    


# Technology
The following technology have been used for this project:

  1. [HTML](https://whatwg.org/)
  2. [CSS](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/)
  3. [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
  4. [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)
  5. [JQUERY](https://jquery.com/)

# Code Example
Below are some example for the code has been used and the corresponding outcome:

1. To hide or show the content of different body parts, "setAttribute" with "style" and "display:none" or "display:block" has been used.
    ```Javascript
            // hide a part
             mainBody.setAttribute ("style", "display:none;");
            // show a part
             mainBody.setAttribute ("style", "display:block;");
    ```
2. To add a sound effect for the player choice with right or wrong response, the sound track has embedded into the html file and the execution script has placed in the questionJS javascript file.
   * The embed code in html
   ```html
    <!-- the sound effect link  -->
    <audio id="correctAnsAudio"><source src="assets/audio/Interface-beep-up-sound-effect.mp3"></audio>
    <audio id="wrongAnsAudio"><source src="assets/audio/Fail-sound.mp3"></audio>
   ``` 
   * The script to run the sound track   
    ```Javascript
         // play correct sound effect
            correctSound.play();
        // play wrong sound effect
            wrongSound.play();
    ```
3.  Some function use setTimeout function to delay the execute time in order to let the player to read the response,
    ```Javascript
        // wait for half second and do the following action:
        // 1. hide the result body
        // 2. show high score body
        // 3. reset the input value and message to null
        setTimeout(function(){
            // hide the result body (function sRJS 5)
            hideResultBody();
            // show high score body (viewHighscoreJS - function vHJS 5)
            showHighScoreBody();
            // reset the result input as empty
            resultInput.value = ""; 
            // reset the resultMessage
            resultMessage.textContent =""; 
        },500); 
        } 
    ```
4. As the chorme default setting, the "Clear Highest score" button will stay in focus status after it has been clicked. To fix this issue, "mousedown" and "mouseup" have been used instead of "click" 
   ```Javascript
   // set the click event to execute the clearHighScoreHistory function (function vHJS 3)
        // Note : the button will stay in focus status after click when it is a click function (due to chrome default features)
        // the walkaround is using mousedown and mouseup
    clearRecord.addEventListener("mousedown", clearHighScoreHistory);
    clearRecord.addEventListener("mouseup", function blurInput() {
        document.getElementById('clearRecord').blur();
      });
    ```
